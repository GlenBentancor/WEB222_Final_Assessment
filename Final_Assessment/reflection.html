        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive Design is a design technique that is
        used when trying to make a webpage or application have the most pleasant
        end-user experience across as many devices and browsers as possible.
        This is achieved through scaling elements to the device’s screen and by
        implementing things that will decrease load times. This design approach
        is especially relevant in web technologies for two main reasons. The
        first is that it is more cost-effective to create a website that is
        easily navigable on any device, as opposed to having a version of your
        website or application dedicated to smaller devices and another version
        dedicated to larger devices. This is also applicable to a device’s
        performance, as in, it is more cost-effective to create a website or
        application that works well on both mobile devices and desktops
        regardless of their computing power differences, as opposed to creating
        separate websites/applications for mobile and desktop usage. The second
        reason is that having a website that is friendly to all kinds of devices
        will increase traffic to your website by simply not having users ignore
        or immediately leave your website because it is not easily navigable on
        their devices. A more generalized website will see more traffic than one
        that only caters to one kind of device/ limited range of screen sizes.
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While doing research for this assignment I
        learned the proper usage of the percentage values in CSS. I also learned
        that to effectively create a webpage that works on any device you must
        first focus on one device and then fix any issue that may arise on other
        devices afterwards. This is because it would take too much time to
        create a website that works well on all devices right from the get-go.
        Additionally, I learned that the percentage in CSS stands for the
        percentage of the viewport window of the device which the element should
        take up. For example, in my assignment, I have something similar to:<br />
        header img {<br />
        width: 3%;<br />
        height: 3%;<br />
        }<br />
        This essentially means that the image will only ever take up 3% of the
        viewport window in width and height regardless of the screen size and
        resolution. Through my research, I also learned that media queries can
        be used to implement “breakpoints”. A breakpoint is the point at which
        an element will change if the viewport window reaches a certain size.
        This can be used for example in a list scenario to dictate at which
        point the elements will begin to stack as opposed to sitting side by
        side on a page. Alternatively, breakpoints can be used to dictate at
        which point an image will shrink if you do not wish to scale the image
        to size of the viewport.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course was very intuitive and made grasping
        new concepts easy. It also pushed my understanding of topics discussed
        in class by making me apply said concepts in new ways or in ways not
        discussed in class, in the assignments. The assignments for this course
        were tricky but achievable due to being given and walked through all the
        tools needed for its completion. This course taught me and taught me the
        tools with which to proceed in my learning of web development. <br />
